# PHP-project

# Welcome to my php project

This was another undergrad project done by me. This was certainly the most elaborate one. 

## Project description

This code only contains PHP without any major html structure because I did this for a course and it was a database course.
Used wampp for this and the sql file is given. 
The task for this project was to use MySql commands elaborately of which I used a lot.
Feel free to try it.

## Who this is for

This is for the people who have a basic understanding of PHP and want to do an elaborate project. This might help.
